information disclosed by a party (“Disclosing Party”) to the other party
(“Receiving Party”), whether orally or in writing, that is designated as
confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given
the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure.  Your
Confidential Information includes Your Data; Our Confidential Information
includes the Services, Content and Software; and Confidential Information of
each party includes the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all Order
Forms (including pricing), as well as business and marketing plans, technology

breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (ii) was known to the
Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach
of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (iii) is received from a third
party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, or (iv)

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>7.2.      <u>Protection

who need that access for purposes consistent with this Agreement and who have
signed confidentiality agreements with the Receiving Party containing
protections no less stringent than those herein.  Neither party will disclose
the terms of this Agreement or any Order Form to any third party other than its
Affiliates, legal counsel and accountants without the other party’s prior written
consent, provided that a party that makes any such disclosure to its Affiliate,
legal counsel or accountants will remain responsible for such Affiliate’s,
legal counsel’s or accountant’s compliance with this Section 7.2.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>7.3.      <u>Compelled

Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the
disclosure.  If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose the
Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which
the Disclosing Party is a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the
disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its
reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that Confidential
